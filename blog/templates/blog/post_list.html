      <h3><b>TITLE HEADING</b></h3>
      <h5>MY CAT FROM HELL <span class="w3-opacity">July, 12, 2017</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Let me just preface this story with the fact that I was way too old for this to happen to me and for it to be anywhere near acceptable. I've always wanted to have a super close relationship with my neighbors. I would have a best friend that's less than a block away from me and making a profit off of young kids and tired parents. I would make so much money babysitting cute kids and I would become a millionaire. Okay, maybe not that far, but any money is better than none. My first job was given to me by one of my friends that lived two houses down. It was during winter break of freshman year and she needed someone to take care of her cats. Her family was going to India and they said that they would pay me. I was ecstatic. The first day that I went to go feed the cats, I was really excited and I didn't take my phone, thinking that nothing would happen. My brother and I were home alone because my parents went to go pick a christmas tree out. Prior to this, I never really had a pet and was definitely not really fond of cats, but I wasn't scared. The only experience I had with pets were countless fish that died and once in 4th grade I had 2 birds. Finches to be exact. After the fourth grade year ended I decided that I wanted to take home the class pet. I was definitely a irresponsible pet owner, and they became a burden. I was scared of the birds more than they were of me. In hindsight I have no idea why I did this, but I stopped changing their water out. One morning, my brother told me that one of the birds had died. inside the water container. If that isn't symbolic I don't know what is. My brother then proceeded to leave the room, and brought back a ziploc bag with the dead bird in it and shoved it in my face. At this point I was traumatized, I was crying and it was a mess. I haven't had a pet since. Let's just say that the bird was definitely foreshadowing the event sthat would follow 6 years later.
         <br />  Anyways, I went into their basement and cleaned out the litter box. When I was about to go to the top of the stairs, I saw the fattest cat that I've ever seen staring back at me. Bigger than Garfield, his body overfilled the doorway and his legs sunk back into the pool of fat like a turtle. Everytime I got near the top of the stairs, the cat would hiss at me. I was petrified, I definitely thought that that meant he was going to attack me. I decided to wait it out in the basement. I checked all the rooms and there was no other way out. I felt as if every episode of "My cats from Hell," that I watched in elementary school was not doing me any favors. All of the landline phones in the basement were fake and I thought that the broken phones were a sign that I was the main character in a horror film; oblivious, and not knowing how to call for help. Regardless, I tried to occupy myself with other things in the basement, under the impression that the cat would have to leave at some point. The cat definitely knew I was trying to escape becasue everytime I would pass by the stair case he was attentively staring at me with his ears perked up. After worrying about if my neurotic mother would call the cops because she didn't know where I was, I decided to escape out of one of the escape windows in one of the guest rooms. I cleaned the spider webs off of the window and prepped myself to jump out. I forced the glass pane open but the screen door wouldn't open. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS PREVENTED ME FROM MY FREEDOM WAS A SCREEN WINDOW. I WAS NOT READY TO BACK DOWN, so I rpresumed to punch the screen door and when the seal broke I jumped out and ran home barefoot.
        <br />  The moral of the story is to have a handy dad that can ix your neighbor's screen door at sketchy hours during the night so that your neighbors won't notice. I ended up getting paid with a "Christmas Bonus" and to this day they don't know that I broke their window
